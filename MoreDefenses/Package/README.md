# MoreDefenses

Starting with steampunk gun turrets, this mod aims to add more base defenses into the game in a dynamic way.

Tested fully with dedicated servers, and only required by clients. But probably don't take turrets where people don't want them.

Works very well with ValheimRAFT to create gunboats.
